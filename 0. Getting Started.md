# 0. Getting Started

Firstly, I'm going to use [**IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition**](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) to make *working with Java* as painless as possible.

It includes it's own runtime so I don't have to worry about maintining a compatible and secure (patched) JRE, it also manages the JDKs itself too on a per-project basis, and it can manage multiple versions depending on what is required by individual projects. ***As a rule of thumb, I'll be targeting the latest JDK version to ensure I'm able to work with Java's "latest and greatest" features.*

A full list of the reference materials I'll be using will be listed [here](References).
