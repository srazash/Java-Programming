A Java program typically requires a few things to get up and running:

1. A `src` folder within a parent project folder, the project folder typically also contains IDE-specific metadata about the project as well as the `out` folder for any compiled code, in more complex projects it will also contain a lot of other reesource folders.
2. A `package` name and folder, this folder sits in the `src` folder. *This acts as a namespace, and a project can have multiple packages.*
3. A `class` name and file, the file sits in the `package` folder and the first line of the file references the `package` name. A package can, and typically does have multiple class files. *Try not to get comfused between the concept of a Class file which has the .java extension and contains source code in a readable text format, and a compiled .class file which contains bytecode that the JRE reads and executes but is not readable to a person.*
4. A `main` method that Java can recognise as the starting point of the program, this sits within the `class` file and will contain the initial instructions for the program to execute, this can be as simple as a single line which prints text to the screen.

To visualise how this would actually look. We would have `HelloWorld.java` sititng within the `./java-tutorial/src/com.srazash/` directory tree, the contents would look like this:

``` java
package com.srazash;

public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Hello world!");

    }
}
```
